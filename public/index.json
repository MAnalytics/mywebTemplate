Unreported, reported and recorded crime in Greater Manchester 2012-2016\nAbstract: The level of recorded crime varies markedly across Greater Manchester, with deprived communities bearing a disproportionate burden. However, does recorded crime accurately capture inequality in the exposure to crime? Recorded crime is composed of reported incidents that are evidenced by the police to be a crime. If reporting and evidencing are consistent across communities and crime types, then recorded crime can be argued to be reflective of the lived reality. In other words, whilst some crimes remain hidden, their proportionate distribution falls in line with recorded crime. But, if reporting and evidencing varies across communities and by crime type, recorded crime can be argued to be unreflective of the lived reality, to mask hidden inequality in the exposure to crime.\nIn this paper we probe the existence of hidden inequality in the exposure to violent, property and nuisance crimes across communities in Greater Manchester, classified according to their level of deprivation, between 2012 and 2016. To do so, we utilise data from the Crime Survey of England and Wales, reported (incident) and recorded crime data, as well as census data. The research deploys a Bayesian hierarchical space-time model using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to examine the relationships between unreported, reported and recorded crime types across communities and through time. The results demonstrate the existence of marked hidden inequality in the exposure to crime, though this varies substantively by crime type.

A geographical space refers to a large geographical area, such as a town or a city, subdivided into a set of smaller administrative or non-administrative units. An example of an administrative unit is a district, neighbourhood, county or ward demarcation, while an example of a non-administrative unit is a system of regular grid or street network.\nIn spatial analysis, it is often required to modify an existing geographical delineation or create a new one, based on a given specification. The following subsection will talk about two tools, one for creating a new geographical delineation (demarcation), and the other for modifying an existing geographical delineation. The link to download the tools are also provided.\n1. Spatial grid generator: This tool creates a regular grid system over a geographical space. The tool requires a user to supply a spatial boundary of an area (in Esri format - .shp) and specify the grid size. The tool detects the spatial extent of the boundary and automatically create a system of regular grids, of the size specified, over the area. Although, it is possible to create regular grids in the existing GIS software, such as ArcGIS or QGIS, however, the process in these software is not straightforward. Therefore, the key purpose of our Spatial grid generator is to simplify this process. Below are examples regular grid systems of varying sizes, created by this tool, over the City of Chicago.\nInsert figs. here:\nPotential Applications:\nThe use of arbitrary grid system is common in crime analytics for some special reasons, which include confidentiality protection and as alternative in absence of a reasonably small adminstrative units. In particular, the grid systems have been used in hotspot policing in order to enable a more focussed targetting of problematic areas (Mohler et al. 2011).\nThis tool can be downloaded directly from here\n2. BDC_GeoConverter: This tool is developed to complement an online tool called Geoconverter. The Geoconverter is used for matching changed geographical units, or apportioning a dataset from an original geographical demarcation to a modified/changed geographical demarcation. For example, during 2011 UK census, it is observed that some census units, namely LSOAs and OAs, have been modified (either merged or split) when compared to their corresponding 2001 units. In Birmingham city for example, 10%* of 2011 LSOA units were affected. In a longitudinal analysis as an example, the aforementioned changes is problematic.\nIn an effort to address this issue, the online Geoconverter tool is created, in order to apportion any data from 2001 census demarcation to 2011 census demarcation, or vice versa. Alternatively, the tool can be used to generate a look-up table that provides the details those changes that have occured for the entire UK. For example, for any given 2001 unit code, the look-up table provides the corresponding (set of) 2011 unit codes and the share (ratio) of 2001 unit that each has got. The table will give \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; for any unit that remain the same in both years.\nThe look-up table is particularly useful for anyone who might wish to carry out the apportioning task programmatically.\nNow, the BDC_Geoconverter is created to deal with one key problem that is not addressed by the online Geoconverter. The online Geoconverter fails to capture some OAs that exist in 2001 and still exist in 2011, but have now been renamed (i.e. re-coded). This scenario is most common in Scotland area where high-rise buildings were demolished and re-built as smaller building units.\nPlease note that the work of BDC_Geoconverter still depends largely on the look-up table generated from the online Geoconverter.\nThis tool was originally developed for the Crime \u0026amp; Well_Being Big Data Centre and can be downloaded here.\n","date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"8f66d660a9a2edc2d08e68cc30f701f7","permalink":"/project/internal-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/internal-project/","section":"project","summary":"A set of tools for delineating a geographical space","tags":["Delineators"],"title":"Delineators: Geographical Space","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Introduction This section introduces a set of predictive tools for certain geographical processes, such as crime and footfalls. The links to downloading these tools are also provided.\n1. Grid-based Crime Hotspot Predictors Crime Hotspot refers to an area with a high risk of crime. In practice, police are interested in crime hotspot in order to inform crime intervention. However, it requires the use of an analytical technique to identify hotspot areas and be able to rank them according to their level of severity. In a short-term crime intervention, the term predictive hotspot has been coined to represent hotspot types where crimes are expected to occur in a very near future, such as within one or two days. A number of analytical tools have been developed in order to model this type of hotspot - these are the types provided here. In addition, we provide an idea of the relative accuracies of these techniques.\n**Self-Exciting Point Process** **Prospective Space-time Scan Statistics** **Prospective Kernel Density Estiamtion Method** **Prospective Hotspotting**  2. Footfall Predictor This tool was developed as a part of the Surf Project funded by ESRC Future Research Leaders scheme. The tool, named as Leeds Footfall Predictor, built on the work led by Dr. Nick Malleson which determined that the daily footfall rates observed in the Leeds city centre can be explained in terms of external variables, such as temperature, rainfall and holidays (See here). The research involved the application of different machine learning algorithms to a combination of these variables (predictors) and subsequently compared the accuracies of the former. It was established that the Random Forest algorithm by Breiman, 2001 is the most accurate for forecasting footfall rates. Thus, the algorithm, as implemented in R by Liaw and Wiener, 2002, was employed in the development of the Leeds Footfall Predictor. The tool was then deployed using the RShinydashboard platform.\nFigures here (Developed by Monsuru Adepeju)\nFigure above shows the homepage of the tool.

Evidently, there are a number of legitimate reasons why such data might not be available, including confidentiality issues and the lack availability of usable data formats.\nTo the credit of some computer/geospatial scientists, certain successes have been achieved in the areas of geographical modelling through computer simulation approach. However, many of these simulations are often too tailored towards a single problem and may not be extensible to other related problems.\nIn this section, I introduce a dynamic microsimulation framework for simulating crime patterns. Patterns, arising from offenders routines activities have both spatial and temporal signatures of different types. Thus, this framework is aimed at allowing different combinations of these spatio-temporal signatures to be simulated.\nThis framework was originally described here.\nA dynamic microsimulation framework for simulating different spatio-temporal crime patterns (DMfC). In the field of animal ecology, foraging animals are known to act cautiously in relation to the locations they prey - while in pursuit of food, they do not want to become foods for others. In the field of criminology, this behavioural pattern has been likened to that of a human offender who carefully chooses his victims while, at the same time, avoiding being arrested. In constrast to criminology, a considerable progress has been made in modelling these foraging behaviours in animal ecology using computer simulation (Morales et al., 2004; McClintock et al., 2012). This DMfC builds on this progress and adapt the SimRiv R-package (Quaglietta and Porto, 2017) to synthesise a set of offenders and their potential victims within a hypothetical, constraint environment.\nThe DMfC allows the user to specify the levels of spatial clustering and the type of temporal patterns to simulate. The interaction between spatial and temporal specifications results into a unique spatio-temporal pattern, which can be used for further crime studies.
